# Marketing Psychology

This skill bridges the gap between design and human behavior, focusing on how to influence user decisions ethically.

## 1. Cognitive Biases in Design

- **Scarcity & Urgency**:
  - "Only 2 items left in stock" or "Offer ends in 5m".
  - *Use*: To encourage immediate action. *Caution*: Do not fake this; it destroys trust.
- **Social Proof**:
  - Reviews, testimonials, "10,000+ users".
  - *Use*: To reduce anxiety and validate choices.
- **Anchoring**:
  - Displaying a higher price first (the anchor) makes subsequent prices seem lower.
  - *Use*: In pricing tables (e.g., Strike-through pricing).
- **Hick’s Law**:
  - The more choices, the longer it takes to decide.
  - *Use*: Simplify navigation and form steps. Prevent "Analysis Paralysis".
- **The Von Restorff Effect**:
  - The item that stands out is arguably the most remembered.
  - *Use*: Make your primary CTA (Call to Action) visually distinct.

## 2. Copywriting for Conversion

- **Benefit-Oriented Headers**:
  - *Bad*: "Our Features"
  - *Good*: "Save 10 Hours a Week"
- **Microcopy**:
  - Small text snippets (button text, error messages) matter.
  - *Instead of* "Submit", use "Get My Free Guide".
- **Active Voice**:
  - Speak directly to the user ("You") and use strong verbs.

## 3. Trust Indicators

Building credibility is essential for conversion.

- **Visual Polish**: High-quality design = perceived high-quality product (Aesthetic-Usability Effect).
- **Security Badges**: Padlocks, "Secure Checkout".
- **Transparency**: Clear return policies, no hidden fees.
- **Authority**: Press logos, "As seen in...".

## 4. User Flow & CRO

- **The F-Pattern & Z-Pattern**:
  - Users scan content in these shapes. Place key info on these paths.
- **Above the Fold**:
  - The most critical value proposition and CTA must be visible without scrolling.
- **Friction Reduction**:
  - Remove unnecessary form fields.
  - Allow "Guest Checkout".
  - Use smart defaults.

## 5. Ethical Considerations

- **Dark Patterns**: Avoid manipulative tactics like "roach motels" (easy to get in, hard to get out) or "confirmshaming" ("No, I don't like saving money").
- **Goal**: Help users make the decision that is best *for them*, which ideally aligns with your business goals.
